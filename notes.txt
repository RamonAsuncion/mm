- I'm creating this MM for my OS used globally (flat memory model).

I need to know where the chunk of free memory is you can play with. 

For a flat memory model, it can be at the end of my kernel code (say the 1/2MB mark) to the end of the system memory 
For a paging kernel, this can be the beginning of the page to the end of the page.
